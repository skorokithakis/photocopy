photocopy
=========

A script to archive photos off a camera or directory to a directory named by file date. 
It will prefer to use the EXIF date in the file. If not present it will skip file unless the flag `-x no` 
(do not skip files without EXIF date) is passed in which case it will use file system creation date. All operations
are logged into the target directory in a text file. 

Installation
------------

Just run:

    1. Clone down the repo, or just download `photocopy.py`
    2. pip install docopt
    3. pip install hachoir
    4. Then execute the script using python.

You're ready to use it!


Usage
-----
Photocopy recursively reads the EXIF data from images and other file types (see below) in source directory and copies the files to a
specified target directory with subdirectories for the creation dates of the files. It does not rename files. A use case is that 
you have an SD card from your camera, or a folder from a remote syncing service, and want to copy all the images/videos into specific 
directories by day.

You run it with:

    ./photocopy.py /media/sdcard/ /home/user/Photos/
    
 #### Examples:
    
 1. Simple. Copy jpg or JPG files from source (Z:\photosync) to target into folders
       named YYYY_MM_DD using the EXIF Creation Date in the JPG files. Ignore files without
       EXIF date, but log everything.
       
        python photocopy.py -j jpg Z:\photosync target/
        
2. More complex. Move (-m yes) files by extensions (-j gif,png,jpg,mov,mp4) shown from source (Z:\photosync) to target into folders   
        named YYYY_MM_DD using the EXIF Creation Date in the files. File without EXIF date will use the file
        system creation date (-x no -- means do not skip) to name target folders. Log everything.
        
        python photocopy.py -m yes -x no -j gif,png,jpg,mov,mp4 Z:\photosync target/

and it will copy the photos to directories called "2014_03_12" by default.
See the source file for more examples.
